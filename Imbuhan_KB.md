Malay Affixes (Imbuhan) – Comprehensive Guide and Teaching Strategies
Overview of Malay Affixes (Imbuhan)
Imbuhan are affixes in Malay attached to root words (kata dasar) to form new words. They include prefixes (awalan) added to the beginning, suffixes (akhiran) added to the end, circumfixes (apitan) that wrap around a root (prefix + suffix together), and infixes (sisipan) inserted inside a root word. Mastering imbuhan is crucial because affixation is very productive in Malay – it creates new words and conveys grammatical relationshipsmlcs.moe.edu.sg. However, imbuhan can be complex, with many rules and exceptions, often confusing learnersmlcs.moe.edu.sg. This is especially true for students who are native English speakers learning Malay as a second language, since English uses affixes differently and less extensively.
Why focus on imbuhan? Using correct affixes is essential for grammatical Malay sentences, in both writing and formal speechmlcs.moe.edu.sg. For example, Malay often requires an affix where English might use a separate word or no change at all. A student must learn not just the meaning of affixes but also how they attach (including spelling changes) and when to use them. Below, we organize the affixes by group and provide: simple definitions, formation rules (with patterns and exceptions), examples (and counterexamples) suitable for young learners, and teaching tips. We prioritize the most common affixes for primary-level Malay – prefix meN-, prefix beR-, prefix peN-, and the suffixes -kan and -i – then outline others for more advanced (secondary) learning. These affixes form the backbone of many Malay verbs and nouns, so building a strong understanding early (with scaffolded practice) helps learners progress to intermediate levels.
Note: In the examples, base words will be in bold, and affixes underlined for clarity. We also occasionally use English approximations to guide understanding, but keep in mind Malay affixes often have no direct one-to-one equivalent in English.

Prefix meN- (Active Verb Prefix)
Function: The prefix meN- (with N representing a nasal consonant that varies) is used to form active verbs (kata kerja aktif). It is added to noun or verb bases to indicate an action (often something the subject does). These meN- verbs are frequently transitive (needing an object) but can also be intransitive for certain actions. In simple terms, meN- roughly corresponds to English “to (do X)” or “to perform X”, turning a base into an action: e.g. meN- + lukis (draw) = melukis (“to draw”)anyflip.com. In Malay, using meN- is often required to mark a formal verb, whereas in English the base word might already serve as a verb.
Forms and spelling rules: The prefix meN- has several forms (allomorphs) – me-, mem-, men-, meng-, meny- (and menge- for some short bases) – depending on the first letter of the base wordanyflip.comanyflip.com. When attaching meN-, certain initial letters of the base undergo changes (often the first consonant is dropped and replaced by a nasal). This is known as nasal assimilation. The patterns are:
•	Base starts with p – p is dropped and mem- is used.
o	Contoh: putus → memutus = memutus (to break off).
o	Example: pakai (to wear/use) → memakai = memakai (“to wear”). Here the base “pakai” loses p and takes mem-anyflip.com.
•	Base starts with t – t is dropped and men- is used.
o	Contoh: tulis → menulis = menulis (to write)anyflip.com.
o	Example: tengok (to look) → menengok = menengok (to visit/see casually). Note: In many cases like menulis, the t sound vanishes in spelling.
•	Base starts with k – k is dropped and meng- is used.
o	Contoh: kemas (tidy) → mengemas = mengemas (“to tidy up”)anyflip.com.
o	Example: kajar (to chase) → mengejar = mengejar (to chase). The k is removed, prefix meng- attaches. (See “menge-” note below for one-syllable bases.)
•	Base starts with s – s is dropped and meny- is used (the s is replaced by ny sound)anyflip.com.
o	Contoh: sapu (sweep) → menyapu = menyapu (to sweep).
o	Example: sukat (measure) → menyukat = menyukat (to measure out). The s is dropped and ny added after me- (spelled meny-).
•	Base starts with a vowel (a, e, i, o, u) or h, g, or other consonants not covered above – use meng- (no letter dropped).
o	Contoh: ambil (take) → mengambil = mengambil (to take).
o	Example: urut (massage) → mengurut = mengurut (to massage).
o	Example: gali (dig) → menggali = menggali (to dig). Here, the base “gali” keeps its g, so the result menggali has a double-g spelling (pronounced with a single /g/ sound after the /ŋ/).
o	Example: hantar (send) → menghantar = menghantar (to send).
•	*Base starts with m, n, ny, ng, l, r, w, y – use me- (the N of meN- assimilates to these sounds by effectively not adding an extra consonant). The base’s first letter remains.
o	Contoh: mandi (bathe) → memandi = memandi (rarely used; typically one would just say mandi, but memandikan exists with suffix). For a clearer example:
o	Example: lari (run) → melari = melari (not used alone; see berlari for “to run”, but appears in melarikan, “to run away with/carry off”).
o	Example: nyanyi (sing) → menyanyi = menyanyi (to sing). Here, no additional letter is needed; ny remains at the start (note meny- also appears, but it’s actually me + base “nyanyi”).
o	Example: rasa (feel) → merasa = merasa (to taste/feel).
o	Example: warna (color) → mewarna = mewarna (to color).
o	Example: yakin (sure) → meyakinkan = meyakinkan (to convince)anyflip.comanyflip.com.
Special case – “menge-” for short roots: If the base word is a single-syllable or very short (often consonant-vowel-consonant), Malay sometimes uses menge-. This is effectively meng + e inserted to aid pronunciation and maintain the syllable structure. For example: pos (mail) → mengepos (to mail something), cat (paint) → mengecat (to paint)mlcs.moe.edu.sgmlcs.moe.edu.sg. Without the extra “e”, forms like mengcat would be unpronounceable, so menge- is the fixed form for such short bases. This is usually introduced at secondary level if needed, as these bases are less common for young learners.
Exceptions: Most Malay base words follow the above rules, but there are a few noteworthy irregularities:
•	Some words starting with k keep the k instead of dropping it, to avoid confusion with another word. Contoh: kaji (study/examine) can form mengkaji = mengkaji (“to examine in depth”), even though by rule one might expect mengaji. In fact, mengaji exists with a different meaning (“to recite [Quran]” or colloquially “to study” in a religious context). So, mengkaji is used to clearly mean “to research”prpm.dbp.gov.my. Similarly, kritik -> mengkritik (“to criticize”) retains the k for clarity. These are relatively advanced vocabulary; primary students can be made aware that a few words don’t drop the letter k, but they will learn details later.
•	A few base words have merged forms. For example, upa (an archaic/rare root) would lead to mengupas, but such cases are not common in primary materials.
•	If a base already begins with a nasal sound that matches the prefix (e.g. m, n), sometimes the meN- prefix may appear as menge- to avoid doubling an identical syllable. However, this is a nuance beyond primary scope.
Summary Chart – Prefix meN- Assimilation:
Base starts with	meN- form	Example
p (drop p)	mem-	paku → memaku (to nail)
t (drop t)	men-	tanam → menanam (to plant)
k (drop k)	meng-	kemas → mengemas (to tidy)
s (drop s)	meny-	sapu → menyapu (to sweep)
a/e/i/o/u or h/g (vowel, etc.)	meng-	ambil → mengambil (to take)
b, f (and sometimes v)*	mem-	baca → membaca (to read)
c, d, j (and sy, z)*	men-	cuci → mencuci (to wash)
m, n, ny, ng, l, r, w, y	me-	lapor → melapor (to report)
(Loanwords with f, z, sy, etc. follow the closest category: e.g. f → memf- (no drop), z → menz- (no drop), sy (as in syarat) often takes men- without dropping sanyflip.comanyflip.com. Such details can be left for later learning.)
Meaning and usage: For young learners, emphasize that meN- shows someone doing an action. Often meN- verbs are something you can put “sedang” (am/are/is [doing]) in front of. For example: Ali sedang membaca buku. – “Ali is reading a book.” The prefix mem- on baca tells us Ali is actively doing the action of reading. Many base words by themselves (e.g. baca) can function as imperatives or informal verbs, but in complete sentences we usually use the affixed form (membaca). For primary students, it’s useful to start with familiar base words and show how adding meN- turns them into actions:
•	makan (eat) → makan (this one is a special case – “makan” is already a base verb; memakan is used in formal contexts or to mean “to consume [something]”). You might introduce that memakan masa means “to consume time” (take time), whereas everyday “eat” is just makan. This shows not all verbs need an affix colloquially, but affixes appear in certain contexts.
•	beri (give) → memberi (to give).
•	main (play) → bermain (to play) – here we see a base that uses a different prefix (beR-), which we’ll explain later. Not all actions use meN-; some use beR-. This can spark a discussion on how to decide which prefix is needed.
Teaching Tip – Pattern Recognition: Introduce the assimilation rules as a fun pattern-finding activity. List several meN- verbs and their root words, and have students spot what happens to the first letter. For example: membaca – baca, menulis – tulis, mengemas – kemas, menyapu – sapu. They will notice b stays (just added mem-), t disappears (menulis has no t), k disappears (mengemas no k), s disappears (menyapu no s). Encourage them to articulate the rule: p, t, k, s at the start of a word will hilang (vanish) and change to m, n, ŋ, ny respectively when adding meN-. One memorable mnemonic some teachers use is the phrase “Sony Pam Tin Kosong.” This acrostic encodes the changes: S → ny (as in Sony), P → m (Pam), T → n (Tin), K → ∅ (zero, as in kosong, and note k → “ng” sound)mlcs.moe.edu.sgmlcs.moe.edu.sg. Each word’s ending hints at the new letter: Sony ends in -ny (so S→ny), Pam ends in -m (P→m), Tin ends in -n (T→n), and kosong ends in -ng (K→ng). Such mnemonics can help students remember the spelling changesmlcs.moe.edu.sgmlcs.moe.edu.sg. You can create a colorful chart or flash cards for “P, T, K, S” with arrows to “M, N, Ŋ, NY”.
Practice for primary: Start with common actions around school/home: menulis (to write), membaca (to read), menggunting (to cut, from gunting – scissors), menonton (to watch, from tonton), menyanyi (to sing). Have students match the affixed form to pictures (e.g., a picture of a child reading – label it membaca). Another activity: give them a base word and ask them to add meN- (e.g. lukis → ? they answer melukis). Provide the rule cheat-sheet so they can check the first letter and apply the correct form. Because research shows students struggle even after being taught these rulesmlcs.moe.edu.sg, reinforce them often with varied exercises: cloze sentences, word construction races, and even digital quizzes (teachers have used Kahoot! to drill meN- forms in a fun waymlcs.moe.edu.sgmlcs.moe.edu.sg).
Common misconceptions & errors:
•	Using the wrong nasal or not dropping the letter: Young learners might produce forms like mensapu or menbaca, applying men- or men- incorrectly. Gently correct by referring to the pattern chart: “Base sapu starts with S, so S becomes NY – the correct form is menyapu, not mensapu. Let’s check our chart.” Spelling errors like menyapu spelled as manyapu or menapu can occur; emphasize the ny digraph is a single sound.
•	Forgetting to use meN- in writing: In everyday spoken Malay (especially informal or dialectal), people sometimes drop prefixes (Dia beli buku instead of Dia membeli buku). Students might imitate this in writing. Clarify the difference between conversational shortcuts and formal grammar. For primary levels, encourage the use of affixed forms in sentences. For instance, “Saya membaca buku” is preferred over “Saya baca buku” in formal writingmlcs.moe.edu.sg. One strategy is to have them convert a colloquial sentence to a formal one by adding the correct affixes.
•	Overusing meN- where it doesn’t apply: Not all Malay verbs take meN- (some use beR-, some are simple, some use other prefixes). A common example: main (to play) – students might say memain (which is incorrect). The correct form is bermain. This is a good segue into teaching ber-: explain that certain actions use beR- instead of meN-, often when the action doesn’t need an object (intransitive actions or doing something for oneself). A tip: If you can ask "… apa?" (what?) after the verb, it likely uses meN- (because it takes an object). If not, it might be a beR- verb or no prefix. For example, Ali bermain. (What is Ali playing? It can stand alone or say bermain bola – playing ball, no direct object needed in the same way as makan nasi where nasi is required). We will detail this under beR-.
Scaling up to secondary: At the secondary level, students delve deeper into meN- usage. They learn about transitivity (meN- often marks transitive verbs), and more exceptions or special cases: e.g. the prefix menge- for monosyllabic words (like mengecas, mengebom), and handling of loan words (e.g. mengedar from edar, memfailkan from fail). They also encounter the passive voice, which is formed with the prefix di- (so understanding meN- helps to understand di-, since passive di- verbs correspond to active meN- verbs). Encourage secondary students to use the meN- prefix consistently in formal writing and to identify the base word and meaning. They should practice transforming sentences from active to passive (e.g. Ali menulis surat. → Surat itu ditulis oleh Ali.) to reinforce understanding of meN- in contrast with di-. More advanced nuances, like when a meN- verb can be intransitive (e.g. menari – to dance, no object) or when meN- is optional, can also be explored. By secondary, students should internalize the meN- spelling changes; teachers can present challenging “find the error” exercises where a verb is affixed wrongly and students correct it, reinforcing rules.

Prefix beR- (Intransitive/Stative Verb Prefix)
Function: The prefix beR- (short for ber-, with the r sometimes assimilating) forms intransitive verbs – actions that do not require a direct object – as well as verbs indicating having or wearing something, or engaging in a state. In English, this can correspond to “to be/have/do [the base]”. For example, beR- + main = bermain (“to play” – an action one does, not done to something), beR- + lari = berlari (“to run”), beR- + anak = beranak (“to have children”), beR- + baju = berbaju (“to be clothed/wearing a shirt”). Unlike meN-, beR- verbs are usually not followed by a noun acting as a patient/object. They either stand alone or are followed by adverbs/prepositional phrases. Think of beR- as indicating the subject is doing something for themselves or in a general way.
Formation: The prefix is written as ber-, but it may appear as bel- in a few cases. There is essentially one form (no complex letter-changing like meN-), but with some sound assimilation:
•	If the base starts with r, the “r” sound of ber- will merge with the base’s r (pronounced as a single /r/). In writing, both r’s remain because one is in the prefix, one in the root, but in pronunciation it’s one sound. Contoh: ber + renang = berenang (to swim)sarahmyzukhe.blogspot.com. We spell it berenang (with one 'r' in spelling after be), effectively the prefix “ber-” loses its ‘r’ sound into the base. Similarly: ber + rasa = berasa (to feel [a certain way]), ber + ratus = beratus (to number in the hundreds).
•	Exception – “bel-” form: A small number of verbs use bel- instead of ber-. These are historical/lexical exceptions and must be memorized. The three classic ones are: belajar (to learn/study) from ajarsarahmyzukhe.blogspot.com, belayar (to sail) from layar, and bekerja (to work) from kerjasarahmyzukhe.blogspot.comanyflip.com. Here, ber- became bel- (for belajar, belayar) or be (with the root’s first letter assimilated, e.g. bekerja sounds like be-kĕrja where the first ‘r’ isn’t pronounced). Belajar is extremely common (all students know it means “to study”), so point out that we say belajar, not berajar. Bekerja is also common for “to work” (not berkerja in standard Malay spellingsarahmyzukhe.blogspot.com). These exceptions can “impact teachers when teaching imbuhan ber- to primary pupils” because they break the usual patternsarahmyzukhe.blogspot.com – so highlight them explicitly. A simple way: put a big star next to belajar and bekerja on your notes and say “Just remember these two don’t behave like the others.”
•	If the base word has the pattern where the first syllable starts with a consonant and second letter is “er”, the r in ber- is not dropped in spellingsarahmyzukhe.blogspot.com (though some speakers may drop it in casual pronunciation). Example: ber + derma = berderma (“to give to charity”). Even though “derma” already has “er”, we still write berderma. The same goes for berseronok (ber + seronok = have fun) – keep the r. Essentially, aside from the special cases like belajar, ber- attaches to any base; we always write “ber” (or “bel” for the few exceptions) together with the base as one word, no space.
Meaning and usage: There are a few common meanings that ber- conveys:
1.	Doing an action (intransitively): e.g. berlari (to run), bersin (to sneeze, from sin – sneeze), bermain (to play). These verbs don’t take a direct object. You can run (Ali berlari), sneeze (Dia bersin), play (Mereka bermain), without necessarily saying what you run or sneeze or play what – the action is complete by itself or has an implicit object (like bermain bola – playing ball – where “ball” is more like the means).
2.	Having/possessing something (stative): e.g. berbaju (lit. “to have clothing” = to be clothed), bermata biru (“to have blue eyes”), beranak (“to have offspring” – often used for animals meaning “to give birth” or people meaning “to bear children”). This is like saying “with ____”. Dia berbaju merah means “She is wearing a red shirt” (has red clothing on).
3.	Using or equipped with something: e.g. bersenjata (armed, with a weapon, from senjata), berpayung (carrying/using an umbrella, from payung – umbrella).
4.	Reciprocal or collective action: e.g. berkelahi (to fight with each other), berpelukan (to hug each other; with suffix -an in that case), berkongsi (to share together). This hints at doing something in a mutual or together manner, though these may be introduced later.
5.	In fixed expressions: e.g. berjaya (to succeed, from jaya – success), bermula (to begin, from mula – start). Sometimes the meaning isn’t obvious from the root alone (these can be treated as vocabulary).
For primary learners, focus on category 1 and 2 which are concrete:
•	berlari, berjalan, berenang, bersenam (to exercise, from senam), etc. – actions they do.
•	bermain (to play) – very important example where English “play” doesn’t need a preposition but Malay uses ber-.
•	bernyanyi vs menyanyi: interestingly, menyanyi is more common (to sing) but bernyanyi can also mean “sing” (often used in certain contexts or songs). You can mention that sometimes both prefixes exist with subtle differences, but stick to menyanyi for now to avoid confusion.
•	bersekolah (to attend school – literally “to school”), bercuti (to be on vacation, from cuti – holiday).
Teaching Tips:
•	Connect to meN-/ber- distinction: One way to help kids decide between meN- and beR- is by example. Ask: Can this verb take a direct object (answer the question “what?” or “whom?”)? If yes, it’s likely a meN- verb. If no, likely a beR- verb. For example: “Ali ___?” – Ali berlari. (Can we ask “berlari what?” – no, it’s just running, so berlari.) “Ali ___?” – Ali memukul. (“Ali hits.” We can ask “hits what?” – maybe a ball, a person, etc. So memukul is transitive and indeed it’s a meN- verb). Do a group exercise: sort a list of base words into two piles: actions done with an object vs alone. For alone actions, use ber-, for with object, use meN-. (Caution: there are exceptions, but this general guideline works initially.)
•	Use visuals for “ber- = wearing/having”: Show pictures (e.g. a boy with a hat: budak bertopi – a child with a hat). Students describe using ber-: berkasut (wearing shoes), bermata empat (an idiom meaning someone wears glasses – literally “four-eyed” – a fun one for advanced primary). These examples make it concrete that ber- can mean “having/on oneself.”
•	Phrase association: Highlight common daily phrases: berjalan kaki (to walk on foot), beradu (an old word for sleep, maybe too advanced unless in a story), bersin, berteriak (to shout). For any base noun that represents something you can do or have, try adding ber- and see if it makes sense. Sometimes a quick check: does the base word represent something you can “have” or “do by yourself”? If yes, ber- likely fits.
•	Addressing “belajar” and “bekerja”: Since belajar is ubiquitous (every student says saya belajar = I study/learn), point out it’s one of those irregulars where we don’t say berajar. A fun mini-story: “Long ago, people said berajar, but over time it became belajar. We just accept it as a special form.” The kids just need to memorize that one. Same for bekerja. Perhaps use a memory trick: belajar has L like learn, bekerja has kerja (work) but with a be- (not ber-). They might ask why – you can honestly say it’s just an exception, even teachers find it odd but that’s how the language evolvedsarahmyzukhe.blogspot.com.
•	Mix and match practice: Provide some base words and have students try affixing both meN- and beR- to see which yields a meaningful word. For example: lari → berlari (yes, means to run), melari (not an independent verb; exists only in compound melarikan). guna (use) → berguna (meaning “useful”, actually an adjective), mengguna (not complete without -kan, the proper is menggunakan = to use). main → bermain (to play), memain (no, incorrect). This trial and error (with guidance) can solidify which prefix “feels right” for a given base. Always confirm the correct answer and use it in an example sentence.
Common errors:
•	Using ber- when meN- is needed: e.g. berbaca buku (incorrect, should be membaca buku). Students might generalize that all verbs can take ber-. Correct by explaining baca needs an object (what is being read), so it’s a transitive verb – that’s why we use mem- prefix for membaca. If they say berbaca, gently say “Hmm, berbaca isn’t used. We always say membaca. Because you read something, you need the meN- form.” Provide another example: bermakan nasi (wrong) vs memakan nasi. Actually in conversation one would just say makan nasi, but in formal writing memakan could appear. Emphasize correct affix use in writing.
•	Using meN- when ber- is needed: e.g. memain bola (wrong) instead of bermain bola. Or memandi for someone bathing themselves (should be mandi or berenang for swim vs menyelam dive etc.). If a student writes Dia memandi di sungai, they’ve used meN- on mandi unnecessarily. “Mandi” is intransitive (no object; you’re just bathing yourself), so we normally use the base itself or sometimes bermandi in certain phrases (like bermandikan peluh – “bathed in sweat”, which is a different construction). Explain that memandi would need an object, e.g. Ibu memandikan bayi (Mother bathes the baby). Without an object, just say Dia mandi. So, not every base gets an affix in every context; sometimes the base stands alone or uses ber-.
Progressing to secondary: In secondary school, students refine their understanding of beR-. They learn that beR- can attach to nouns, adjectives, etc., and how meaning shifts (the grammar term “ber- kata nama, ber- kata adjektif” etc., meaning ber- + noun indicates having that noun, ber- + adj indicates being in that state, etc.anyflip.com). They also learn about ber-...-an formations (like berpegangan tangan – holding hands together, berbalas pantun – exchanging pantuns). They might meet berulang (to repeat) vs mengulang (to repeat something) to contrast intransitive vs transitive forms. One important secondary insight: some verbs can have both meN- and ber- forms with different meanings. For example, melawan (to oppose/fight something) vs berlawan (to spar or compete against each other), memandu (to drive [a vehicle]) vs berpandu(kan) (to be guided by, or berpandu rarely used alone). These nuances show how affixes alter meaning. Secondary learners also encounter ber- in passive-like or impersonal constructions (such as berkata – literally “to say” as in dia berkata “he said”, functioning without an object). Encourage higher-level students to consult the dictionary or grammar references for any new ber- word to see its root and meaning. Finally, ensure they know ber- never takes an object – if they see a sentence structure “Ber-verb + noun”, that noun is likely not a direct object but something else (either part of a phrase or the noun is actually the root of the ber-verb if written incorrectly). This helps in error correction and in transforming sentences (they won’t mistakenly make a passive from a ber- verb because only transitive meN- verbs can become passive di- forms).

Prefix peN- (Noun Forming Prefix – Agents & Instruments)
Function: The prefix peN- creates noun forms, usually indicating a person, creature, or thing that performs the action of a base verb, or is associated with the base in some way. In English, this is similar to agent nouns ending in -er, -or, -ist (teacher, actor, cyclist) or instrument nouns (marker, blender) derived from verbs. For example, from the verb menulis (to write), we get penulis – meaning “writer” (person who writes). From mengajar (to teach), we get pengajar – “instructor”. From menari (to dance), penari – “dancer”. The peN- prefix essentially nominalizes verbs (and sometimes adjectives) into nouns denoting the doer of the action or the tool for the action or even abstract results of the action.
Forms and assimilation: The prefix peN- mirrors the assimilation patterns of meN- (since they share the same nasal consonant influence). In fact, you can often derive the peN- form if you know the meN- form of a verb: change meN- to peN-. The spelling rules:
•	peN- becomes pe- when attached to base words starting with m, n, ny, ng, l, r, w, y (the nasal or liquid sounds)anyflip.com. No letter is dropped in these cases.
o	Contoh: murah (cheap) – pe + murah = pemurah (generous person; lit. “giver” of cheapness),
o	lari (run) – pe + lari = pelari (runner),
o	nyanyi (sing) – pe + nyanyi = penyanyi (singer),
o	rajin (diligent) – pe + rajin = perajin (not commonly used; orang rajin is used for hard-worker, but perajurit from jurit = soldier, etc.),
o	wangi (fragrant) – pe + wangi = pewangi (perfumer or something that makes fragrant, often refers to air freshener/perfume),
o	yakin (sure) – pe + yakin = peyakin (not used; instead keyakinan = confidence, with circumfix ke-...-an, which is another affix).
•	peN- becomes pem- when the base starts with p or b or f (and sometimes v in loanwords). If the base starts with p, that p is dropped (just like meN-). If it’s b or f, the letter remains after prefixing pem-.
o	Contoh: pukul (hit) – pem + (p)ukul = pemukul (hitter/club, e.g. a tool for hitting like a mallet), the p from pukul is dropped in spelling.
o	pakai (wear/use) – pem + (p)akai = pemakai (wearer/user). Pemakai bahasa = a language user.
o	buat (do/make) – pem + buat = pembuat (maker). Pembuat roti = bread maker (person or machine).
o	baca (read) – pem + baca = pembaca (reader).
o	filem (film) – pem + filem = pemfilem (not commonly used; usually pembikin filem = filmmaker, but pemfail can mean “filer” in admin, or pemfailan = filing (abstract)). For teaching, you might skip f and v cases unless they appear in vocabulary.
•	peN- becomes pen- when base starts with t, d, c, j, z (and note: if t, drop the t)anyflip.com. Also, base starting with s often result in peny- (s dropped, similar to meN-).
o	Contoh: tanam (to plant) – pen + (t)anam = penanam (planter, as in a device or person who plants), t is dropped.
o	tulis (write) – pen + (t)ulis = penulis (writer).
o	didik (educate) – pen + didik = pendidik (educator).
o	cuci (wash) – pen + cuci = pencuci (washer/cleanser, e.g. pencuci baju – washing machine or person who washes clothes).
o	jaga (guard) – pen + jaga = penjaga (guard/caretaker).
o	ziarah (visit) – pen + ziarah = penziarah (visitor, not very common; pelawat is more common for visitor).
o	sapu (sweep) – peny + (s)apu = penyapu (broom – the tool for sweeping!). Here, s drops and prefix is peny-.
o	sanyi (sing, base is actually nyanyi with ny-) – would be penyanyi as above; if a base truly starts with s and has no second consonant, it follows s→ny. Another example: suntik (to inject) – peny + (s)untik = penyuntik (injector, like a syringe perhaps).
o	syarat (condition) – pen + syarat = pensyarah? (No, pensyarah means “lecturer” but comes from syarah (to explain) originally). Actually syarat (condition) with peN- doesn’t form a common word; mensyaratkan is a verb “to stipulate”.
•	peN- becomes peng- when base starts with k, g, h, a, e, i, o, u (vowels, or glottal/h). If k, drop the k.
o	Contoh: kutip (collect) – peng + (k)utip = pengutip (collector, e.g. pengutip derma – donation collector).
o	kaji – peng + (k)aji = pengaji (not used by itself, but in pengajian = studies). However pengkaji with k retained is also used to mean “researcher” (again the k retention as noted for meN- in mengkaji, carries over to pengkaji). This is an advanced exception: base kaji yields both pengaji (in contexts like alat pengajian maybe) and pengkaji (a researcher)prpm.dbp.gov.my. The more common usage is pengkaji. For primary, maybe skip this nuance.
o	gunting (scissors, or to cut) – peng + gunting = penggunting (one who cuts, or a tool for cutting – but since gunting is already scissors, penggunting might refer to a person who cuts hair, etc.).
o	ajar (teach) – peng + ajar = pengajar (instructor).
o	eja (spell) – peng + eja = pengeja (speller; rarely used term).
o	hias (decorate) – peng + hias = penghias (decorator).
o	khianat (betray, where “kh” is treated like k) – pengkhianat (traitor).
o	Vowel examples might not be many at primary level aside from ajar/pengajar, uji (test) → penguji (tester), etc.
•	Special form penge- is used for one-syllable or certain two-syllable bases in some cases, parallel to menge-. For example: bom → pengebom (bomber), cas (charge) → pengecas (charger device). This is a bit advanced; primary students typically encounter these as whole vocabulary words (like pengecas telefon – phone charger) rather than deriving them. If it comes up, just note that pengecas is from cas, by adding peN- with an extra ‘e’ for pronunciation, similar to how mengecas works.
Examples for primary vocabulary:
•	peN- from verbs (people who do things):
o	menulis (to write) → penulis (writer). Example sentence: Ayah saya seorang penulis – “My father is a writer.”
o	membaca (to read) → pembaca (reader). Pembaca berita = newsreader/newscaster.
o	bermain (to play) → pemain (player). pemain bola = ball player (athlete). Pemain is commonly used for sports or games participants.
o	menari (to dance) → penari (dancer).
o	menyanyi (to sing) → penyanyi (singer).
o	mengajar (to teach) → pengajar (instructor/teacher, though a school teacher is usually cikgu/guru, pengajar is a more general term for one who teaches, e.g. in a course).
o	belajar (to learn) → pelajar (student, learner). Note: pelajar looks like peN- + ajar, but remember belajar is the verb “to study”. Historically, pelajar comes from that process. Tell students pelajar = student, an important word. It’s a bit irregular since one might expect pembelajar or pengajar for someone involved in learning/teaching. Instead, pelajar means the person learning, and pengajar means the person teaching – a nice pair to highlight. Many primary kids will know pelajar means student because it’s often used interchangeably with murid.
•	peN- from verbs (tools/things):
o	menulis → penulis (writer, but also penulis can mean a pen in old literature, though normally pen = pen, don’t confuse here; better example for tool:)
o	memotong (to cut) → pemotong (cutter – e.g. pemotong kertas = paper cutter).
o	mengasah (to sharpen) → pengasah (sharpener, like pengasah pensel – pencil sharpener).
o	menyapu (to sweep) → penyapu (broom). Yes, the same word for the person who sweeps and the tool! Usually penyapu refers to the tool (broom).
o	mencuci (to wash) → pencuci (washer/cleaner). E.g. mesin pencuci baju = washing machine, pencuci pinggan = dish cleaner (person or detergent!).
o	membuka (to open) → pembuka (opener). pembuka surat = letter opener, pembuka botol = bottle opener.
•	peN- from adjectives (people with that quality):
o	pandai (clever) → pandai doesn’t take peN- in Malay (no pemandai – use orang pandai). But lembut (soft/gentle) → pelembut (softener, like fabric softener = pelembut fabrik). Not many examples here for primary aside from maybe pemalas from malas (lazy) is not used; they say si pemalas (the lazy person) sometimes. This is less systematic.
Teaching Tips:
•	Relate to meN- verbs: Once students know a meN- verb, ask “What do you call a person who menari (dances)?” If they see the pattern, they might guess penari. Confirm the pattern: “Yes, menari (verb) → penari (person).” Try with others: menulis → penulis, membaca → pembaca. This reinforces both the verb and noun. Make a two-column chart: one column of meN- verbs and one of peN- nouns, and have students draw lines matching them. This shows the relationship and helps vocabulary building in pairs (e.g., to sing – singer, to swim – swimmer in concept, though swimmer in Malay is perenang from berenang, interestingly using peN- on a beR- verb, showing that peN- can derive from any base that results in a noun meaning).
•	Word building games: Provide a list of base words and let students add peN- and see if it forms a known noun. Some will be real, some not. For example: lari → pelari ✅, makan → pemakan (means eater – not common except in phrases like pemakan daging = carnivore; primary kids may not need this), tidur → penidur (not an actual term; we’d say kaki tidur for someone who sleeps a lot, so this one is a trick). When a combination isn’t valid or common, explain briefly or just say “This one doesn’t exist; we use a different word.” It’s good for them to know not every combination is used.
•	Occupations and roles: Use the prefix to teach occupations in Malay. Many job titles are peN- words: pelukis (artist, from lukis – draw), penjual (seller/vendor, from jual – sell), pembaca berita (newsreader), pengadil (referee, from adil – just/fair), pengurus (manager, from urus – manage). Create flashcards with pictures of professions; on the back, write the Malay term with peN-. Students can quiz each other. This connects language with real world context.
•	Tools and objects: Show them that not only people, but objects can be “the doer” of an action. Ask, “What do we call a thing that menulis (writes)? Perhaps something we write with?” Some might say penulis – which literally is “writer” but could they think of a tool? If not, guide them: pensel (pencil) is actually a loanword, not peN-. Try pemotong kertas (paper cutter) or simply pemotong (cutter). Or pembuka tin (can opener). They’ll see the pattern peN- + object: the device that does X. This isn’t a new affix, just applying peN- in context.
Common issues:
•	Spelling errors with nasal assimilation: Similar to meN-, students might miss the dropped letter or wrong nasal. E.g. writing penyapu as pensapu (incorrect – must use ny). Encourage them to apply the same P→M, T→N, S→NY, K→NG rule for peN- as they did for meN-. A memory trick: “meN- and peN- are twins” – they behave the same way with letters. If you remember menyapu, then penyapu will be analogous. Have them practice writing pairs: meN- verb vs peN- noun (membaca/pembaca, menyapu/penyapu, menangkap/penangkap (catcher), menyusun/penyusun (arranger) etc.).
•	Confusion between peN- and per-: Malay has both peN- and per- prefixes. PeN- (with N assimilation) is what we’re learning, which attaches mostly to verb roots to indicate the doer. Per- (with an R, no assimilation) is less common for nouns in modern Malay except a few like pertapa (hermit, from tapa – to meditate), or in some fixed foreign terms. At secondary level they’ll learn pe- (without N) can prefix some nouns/adjectives (like pesuruhjaya – commissioner, from suruh jaya maybe). For primary, it’s enough to focus on peN-. Just be aware if students see persatuan (association, prefix per- + satu + -an) or perempuan (woman, historically peN + empuan actually), they might think it’s the same. You can clarify that per can mean something else (like pergi no, per- in permainan is a circumfix part, etc.). Generally, peN- is productive; per- is often part of circumfix peR-...-an which forms abstract nouns (like persahabatan – friendship). If curious students ask, say “We’ll cover that later; for now, we’re looking at peN- that turns verbs into people/tools.”
•	Using the wrong form for the context: Sometimes a learner might pick the noun form when the verb is needed or vice versa. For example, “Saya pembaca buku itu” (trying to say “I read that book”). Pembaca is a noun (“reader”), not a verb. The correct is saya membaca buku itu. Highlight the difference: membaca = action, pembaca = person doing action. If a student writes Ali adalah penulis surat to mean “Ali wrote a letter,” it actually reads as “Ali is the writer of the letter” – which is grammatically correct, but a roundabout phrasing. The straightforward way: Ali menulis surat. Ensure they know peN- words are nouns and cannot function as the predicate verb without a helping verb (like ialah, adalah, or turning it into a verb phrase with adalah penulis). Simple rule: meN- for actions, peN- for people/things.
Building to intermediate: Secondary students will study peN-…-an circumfix (which makes abstract nouns like pendidikan – education, from didik), the difference between peN- and pe- (short form used with certain bases, especially of foreign origin or fixed forms), and more complex uses such as penge- as mentioned. They’ll also encounter pairs of peN- nouns that relate to different meN- verbs or different meanings (e.g. pelajar vs pengajar we discussed; penonton – viewer from menonton, vs peninjau – observer/scout from meninjau). Encourage intermediate learners to consult the Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka dictionary or online PRPM database for meanings and proper usage of peN- words, as some can carry nuanced meanings or only appear in idiomatic usage. They should also practice converting sentences: e.g. active verb to agent noun – "Cikgu Ahmad mengajar." (Mr. Ahmad teaches) to "Cikgu Ahmad ialah pengajar." (Mr. Ahmad is an instructor). This helps understand how a verb action becomes a noun role. By understanding peN-, they can enrich their vocabulary and better comprehend texts (many Malay texts use peN- nouns for professions, tools, etc.).
________________________________________
Suffix -kan and -i (Transitive Verb Suffixes and Their Usage)
Suffixes -kan and -i are both used to form transitive verbs (kata kerja transitif), often in combination with the meN- prefix (i.e., circumfix meN-…-kan or meN-…-i). They can subtly change the meaning or focus of a verb. Understanding when to use -kan vs -i is a common challenge for learners, but there are some general guidelines. At a basic level, both -kan and -i create verbs that take objects, but they often answer different questions or imply different relations with those objects.
General differences:
•	“-kan” often has a causative or benefactive meaningprpm.dbp.gov.my. Causative means “to cause something to happen” or “to make someone/something [do/be X]”. Benefactive means doing something for someone or to something as a whole. Verbs with -kan frequently translate to “to put/to cause/to make/to ___-en (harden, etc.)” or include an implicit “for.” For example, tidur (to sleep) → menidurkan = “to put to sleep (cause to sleep)” – Ibu menidurkan bayi (Mother puts the baby to sleep). basah (wet) → membasahkan = “to wet (something)” (cause it to be wet). -kan is also used when you do something for someone else: e.g. bacakan (from baca) means “to read (something) for [someone]”. Ibu membacakan adik cerita – Mother reads a story to little brother (for his benefit). In many cases, a -kan verb will be followed by a direct object which is an inanimate thing, and if a person is involved as the beneficiary/receiver, that person is introduced with a preposition (untuk or kepada)prpm.dbp.gov.myprpm.dbp.gov.my. For instance: Ali menghadiahkan basikal kepada adiknya. – Ali gifted a bicycle to his younger siblingprpm.dbp.gov.my. Here basikal (bicycle, a thing) is the direct object of menghadiahkan, and adiknya is introduced with kepada.
•	“-i” often has a locative or goal-oriented meaningprpm.dbp.gov.my. Locative means it’s about the location or target that is affected by the action (on, in, at), or the person who directly receives the action. Verbs with -i can imply doing the action on or to a surface or person. Frequently, the direct object of a “-i” verb is a person or an animate beingprpm.dbp.gov.my, or a place/thing being acted upon in a more specific way (often “to cover/fill/visit/etc. something”). For example, hadiah (gift) → menghadiahi = “to gift (someone) [something]”. In Ali menghadiahi adiknya sebuah basikal, the direct object is adiknya (his younger sibling, a person) – meaning “Ali gifted his brother a bicycle”prpm.dbp.gov.my. Another: kunjung (visit) → mengunjungi = “to visit (a place/person)”. The focus is on the location/person visited. -i can also carry the sense of doing an action in multiple or intensive fashion over the object (e.g. memukuli – to hit repeatedly, from pukul, though in Malay this repetitive meaning is more common in Indonesian and is rarely used in Malay schooling materials). For primary level, focus on the idea that -i often directly attaches a person or place as the object of the verb.
A handy rule of thumb: -kan verbs typically take things as direct objects (and people come after kepada/untuk), whereas -i verbs can take people or places as the direct objectprpm.dbp.gov.myprpm.dbp.gov.my. One teacher’s guideline: “Imbuhan ‘-i’ diikuti orang. Imbuhan ‘-kan’ diikuti benda”es.scribd.com – “‘-i’ is followed by a person, ‘-kan’ is followed by a thing.” This is not a 100% rule but a great starting point. For example:
•	Osman menghadiahkan sebuah basikal kepada Ahmad. (Basikal = thing as object, uses -kan)prpm.dbp.gov.my.
•	Osman menghadiahi Ahmad sebuah basikal. (Ahmad = person as object, uses -i)prpm.dbp.gov.my.
Both mean “Osman gifted Ahmad a bicycle,” but the grammar is different: in the -kan version, “bicycle” is the object and “to Ahmad” is a prepositional phrase; in the -i version, “Ahmad” is the object receiving the action directly, and “a bicycle” is an additional noun (what was given). English can often flip these two (give X to Y vs give Y X) similarly.
Another nuance: -i can emphasize the location or target of the action, whereas -kan can emphasize the *thing being acted upon or the completion of an action. Consider:
•	melekat (stick) → melekatkan = to stick something (somewhere) – focus on the thing you stick or the act of sticking it. Saya melekatkan nota itu di dinding. (I stick that note on the wall – here the note is the object, -kan used).
•	melekat → melekati = to stick onto something – focus on the surface being stuck to. Saya melekati dinding dengan poster. (I stick the wall with posters – meaning I covered the wall by sticking posters on it; dinding is object, showing the locus of sticking).
For primary students, such fine differences might be too detailed. Instead, teach through common examples and set phrases:
Common verb pairs or examples:
•	beri (to give): memberikan vs memberi. Actually memberi already contains an implicit -i (some linguists say it's meN- + beri + -i but the -i doesn’t show in spellingprpm.dbp.gov.my). However:
o	Berikan buku itu kepada saya. – Give that book to me (-kan, book is object).
o	Beri saya buku itu. – Give me that book (here “beri” functions like -i form with person as object, it’s an imperative and we drop the meN- in command). In formal writing, one might say Mengapa kamu memberikan buku itu kepada Ali? vs Mengapa kamu memberi Ali buku itu? The first explicitly uses -kan with “to Ali,” the second uses memberi with two objects (Ali and book). Students usually learn “beri… kepada…” structure. We can highlight that memberikan is followed by kepada [person], whereas memberi can be followed directly by the person then thingprpm.dbp.gov.my.
•	ajar (to teach):
o	Cikgu mengajarkan lagu itu kepada kami. – The teacher taught that song to us (-kan, song is the object, “to us” as beneficiary).
o	Cikgu mengajari kami lagu itu. – The teacher taught us that song (-i, we are the object receiving teaching). Both are intelligible. In Malay, mengajar (with no suffix) is often used: Cikgu mengajar kami Bahasa Melayu. (here kami is effectively a second object without suffix use). So this is a tricky one because ajar can be used without either suffix in many cases. But mengajarkan and mengajari appear in some contexts. Probably advanced for primary – they can stick with mengajar for general use.
•	ingat (to remember/remind):
o	mengingatkan – to remind (cause someone to remember), e.g. Saya ingin mengingatkan kamu tentang kerja rumah. (I want to remind you about homework).
o	mengingati – to remember (to hold in memory), e.g. Kita mestilah sentiasa mengingati jasa pahlawan. (We must always remember the deeds of the heroes). This pair shows -kan made it causative (make someone remember), -i made it direct (remember something). Good for secondary illustration.
•	duduk (sit):
o	dudukkan – to seat (someone) or place something in seated position (causative). Guru mendudukkan murid di kerusi. (The teacher sat the pupil in a chair).
o	duduki – to occupy (a seat/place) or sit for (an exam). Silakan duduki kerusi itu. (Please occupy/sit in that chair). Ali menduduki peperiksaan UPSR tahun lalu. (Ali sat for the UPSR exam last year). Here -i attaches to the thing being sat (chair or exam) to mean occupying it. This is a subtle difference taught in secondary years since it's idiomatic.
•	masuk (enter/put in):
o	masukkan – to put something into... Tolong masukkan buku ke dalam beg. (Please put the book into the bag).
o	masuki – to enter/approach a place (focus on place). Jangan masuki kawasan larangan. (Do not enter the prohibited area – notice kawasan (area) is object). In practice, people often say masuk kawasan without suffix, but memasuki is the formal term.
•	nampak (see/visible):
o	menampakkan – to show/reveal (cause to be seen). Dia menampakkan wajah sedih. (He showed a sad face/made a sad face apparent).
o	menampaki – not commonly used in Malay (exists in Indonesian meaning to step on, from tapak (footstep)).
•	hormat (respect):
o	menghormati – to respect [someone] (direct object is person). Kita harus menghormati ibu bapa. (We must respect our parents). (person as object → -i).
o	menghormatkan – not used. Instead memberikan penghormatan (to pay respects) is used for causative sense, or menghormati covers most meanings of give respect.
From these, for primary focus on a few:
•	beri (give) example is clear and important.
•	hormati (respect) vs (no -kan form) can show that sometimes only one suffix is used for a given concept.
•	baca doesn’t take -i (you don’t say bacai), only bacakan if anything (to read out for someone).
•	lihat (see) → melihat (no suffix needed to mean see), melihatkan (rare, to show), melihati (not used).
•	Perhaps dengar (hear) → mendengar (hear), mendengarkan (to listen to something actively or to broadcast something). E.g. Dia mendengar muzik. vs Dia mendengarkan lagu untuk kami. Slight difference. This is more intermediate.
Teaching strategy for primary: Instead of overwhelming grammar terms, teach -kan and -i via specific verbs in context:
•	Use menghadiahkan vs menghadiahi as a model pair since DBP themselves use it as an exampleprpm.dbp.gov.my. Make a mini dialogue or role-play: Ali mendapat hadiah basikal. Ayahnya berkata: “Basikal ini Ayah berikan kepada kamu.” (Ayah menghadiahkan kamu basikal ini.) Or conversely, Ayah menghadiahi Ali sebuah basikal. Have students rephrase one to the other: “How would this sentence sound if we use -kan instead of -i?” This shows both structures and that they mean basically the same thing with a word order change. Emphasize the rule: -kan: thing as object, person with kepada; -i: person as object, thing comes after. You can even write a template on board:
o	[Subject] [meN-…kan] [Thing] kepada [Person]. (e.g. Osman menghadiahkan basikal kepada Ahmad.)prpm.dbp.gov.my
o	[Subject] [meN-…i] [Person] [Thing]. (e.g. Osman menghadiahi Ahmad basikal.)prpm.dbp.gov.my
This visual mapping helps them see the difference in sentence structure.
•	Create simple fill-in-the-blank exercises where context suggests one or the other: “Encik Ravi ________ (beri) anaknya hadiah.” If the blank is before “anaknya hadiah”, you expect menghadiahi anaknya hadiah (because “anaknya” is right after the verb, so use -i and no kepada). If it were “hadiah kepada anaknya”, answer would be menghadiahkan. By practicing these, they internalize when each suffix is used.
•	Physical metaphor: Some teachers illustrate -i vs -kan by spatial idea. Imagine the action as an arrow: in -i, the arrow goes directly into the object (usually a person or place – “target-focus”); in -kan, the arrow goes outward from the object (do something to the thing, often for someone’s benefit). For example, menghormati guru – the respect goes directly to the teacher (teacher is object of respect); menghormatkan guru isn’t used, but if it were, it would mean to cause respect for the teacher (like maybe to honor the teacher by doing something). This might be too abstract, but sometimes an analogy like -i is like touching the object, -kan is like moving the object can help certain learners. For instance: “Cat dinding” – cat = paint (verb), dinding = wall. Mengecat dinding = paint the wall (no suffix needed actually, cat is transitive by itself). But warnakan dinding (color the wall) vs warnai dinding (not common, they say mewarna dinding or mewarnai in Indonesian). Not the best example. Instead: isi botol – mengisi botol = fill the bottle (bottle is object, we use -i? Actually isi is a base that often goes with -kan: isikan air ke dalam botol means fill water into the bottle). See, isi as base is tricky. Perhaps skip.
•	Common set phrases: Teach a few fixed usages:
o	Tolong pasangkan kipas ini. – Please install/attach this fan (to something). Versus Tolong pasangi lampu ini. Not typical, we’d say Tolong pasangkan lampu (because attach a lamp). So maybe not.
o	Sila matikan suis – Please turn off the switch (suis as object, -kan because you cause it to be dead/off).
o	Sila hidupkan enjin – Please start the engine (cause it to live).
o	Lap meja ini. vs Lapkan meja ini. We normally just say lap meja (wipe table). Lapkan might imply "wipe it for someone."
o	When in doubt doing commands, using -kan is often safer: Bukakan pintu (open the door [for someone]).
Misconceptions and corrections:
•	Mixing them up in context: If a student writes Saya mengucapkan awak tahniah, this is incorrect usage. Ucapan (speak/express) with -kan should have tahniah (congratulations) as object and the person with kepada: Saya mengucapkan tahniah kepada awak. If they want to say directly, they should use mengucapi (not used) or simply mengucapkan tahniah. Actually, Malay would prefer Saya mengucapkan tahniah kepada awak. Correct by explaining that when saying "congratulate someone", the someone must come after kepada with the -kan form. Or use memberi ucapan tahniah.
•	“meminjam” vs “meminjamkan” confusion: Many learners mix up borrow and lend because in Malay they are distinguished by suffix:
o	meminjam = to borrow (to take something for a while) – you do this from someone. Saya meminjam buku daripada perpustakaan. (I borrow a book from the library).
o	meminjamkan = to lend (to give something for a while) – you do this to someone. Perpustakaan meminjamkan buku kepada saya. (The library lends a book to me).
If a student says Saya meminjamkan buku dari perpustakaan, they’ve literally said "I lend a book from the library," which is wrong logically and grammatically (should be meminjam). So reinforce: -kan here changes the direction of action. Check who is the subject and object. The one who gives out (lends) uses -kan, the one who takes (borrows) uses no suffix. A fun way: have two students act: one as library, one as student, with a book prop. Narrate the exchange with correct suffixes.
•	Redundancy: Sometimes students put both untuk and -i or misuse untuk/kepada. For example: Dia menghadiahi kepada adik sebuah buku. This is wrong because menghadiahi already attaches the person directly; using kepada as well is a redundancy error. Correct: either menghadiahkan sebuah buku kepada adik or menghadiahi adik sebuah buku, not mix. If such errors appear, use them as teaching moments: “Notice menghadiahi already means giving to someone, so no kepada needed. With menghadiahkan, you need kepada because the verb expects the thing as direct object and the person after.” Maybe do a fill-in exercise: if the sentence has kepada, use -kan; if not, use -i.
•	Interchangeability: Some verbs accept both suffixes with little or no change in meaningprpm.dbp.gov.my, which can confuse learners who overgeneralize. For instance Ali membaiki kereta vs Ali membaikkan kereta – both can mean “Ali repaired the car”prpm.dbp.gov.my. Students might ask which is right. According to DBP, a small number of verbs can use either and mean the sameprpm.dbp.gov.my. However, usually one form is more idiomatic. For repair, membaiki is standard. Membaikkan is seldom used in contemporary Malay (though grammatically possible). If a student uses one over the other in these interchangeable cases, it’s not a huge error. Just let them know "membaiki is more common." Other near-synonyms: mengubati vs mengubatkan (to cure, treat – usually mengubati pesakit is used), menyakiti vs menyakitkan (“to hurt [someone]” – menyakiti hati vs menyakitkan hati, both mean to hurt someone’s feelings, with slight nuance). For primary, probably skip these; focus on correct usage for each verb as encountered.
Gradation tips:
For primary level, teach -kan and -i through concrete examples (like gifting, giving, telling, etc.) and simple rules (like the person vs thing rule). They might not master it immediately, but exposure helps. Reinforce through usage: When they make sentences, if an error with -kan/-i comes up, gently remind them of the pattern. Provide sentence construction exercises where they have to transform one structure to the other (this not only teaches affixes but also flexible sentence structures).
At secondary level, students are expected to know these suffixes and will face more complex uses in exams (including error-spotting or choosing the correct affix in multiple-choice questions). Emphasize the three official “functions” that DBP highlightsprpm.dbp.gov.my:
1.	Kausatif (causative) – associated with -kan.
2.	Lokatif (locative) – associated with -i.
3.	Some verbs where meaning doesn’t change between -kan and -i (they should memorize which those are, limited set)prpm.dbp.gov.my.
Encourage secondary learners to practice by writing pairs of sentences and discussing the nuance. Also, when learning new vocabulary, note if it’s a -kan or -i verb. For example, mengisi (to fill) and memasukkan (to put something into) both relate to “fill/insert” but are used differently: mengisi borang (fill a form) vs memasukkan surat ke dalam sampul (insert letter into envelope). These distinctions become clearer with lots of reading and usage. They might also learn passive voice forms: -kan and -i verbs become -kan and -i in passive as well (with di-, e.g. diberikan, diberi), and the passive construction changes depending on suffix usage (e.g. Basikal diberikan kepada Ali. vs Ali diberi basikal.). This mirrors the active structures learned earlierprpm.dbp.gov.my, showing the consistency of who is the subject/object.
In summary, mastering -kan and -i is a gradual process. With patient practice and linking the usage to meaning (who/what is affected), learners will start to pick the right one by feel. Always remind them: when in doubt, think about what is the direct object of your sentence – if it’s a person, likely -i, if it’s a thing, likely -kan (plus kepada for the person).

Other Affixes and Advanced Notes
Malay affixation is rich; aside from meN-, beR-, peN-, -kan, -i discussed above, students will encounter other affixes as they advance. Here’s a brief overview to complete the picture, along with tips on teaching them:
•	Prefix di- – This is essentially the passive voice marker for verbsanyflip.com. di- + verb indicates the action is done to the subject by someone/something. For example, active Ali memukul bola (Ali hits the ball) vs passive Bola dipukul Ali (The ball is hit by Ali). In primary school, imbuhan di- is often introduced to understand instructions or sentences in passive form. Key teaching point: “di-” (prefix) is always written together with the verb, and not to be confused with the preposition “di” (meaning “at/in/on”) which is written separately. Many natives even make the mistake of writing di as one word when it shouldn’t be, so instill this rule early: di + noun for location (space in writing), di- + verb for passive (no space). An example misconception to catch: di makan vs dimakan. “Nasi dimakan oleh kucing.” (The rice was eaten by the cat) should be one word dimakanprpm.dbp.gov.my. If a student writes di makan, correct it – that would read as a locative phrase “at eat” which is nonsense. For teaching, you can have sentences where they must choose to separate or not (e.g. di rumah vs diRumah (wrong), ditulis vs di tulis (wrong)). Emphasize that di- is the counterpart to meN-; every transitive meN- verb can be made passive with di-. Secondary students will practice changing active to passive and vice versa, so ensure they know how to identify the object and subject in those transformations.
o	Also mention “ter-” vs passive di- sometimes confuses usage, but ter- is a different prefix (see below).
•	Prefix ter- – ter- has a few uses:
1.	Accidental/Involuntary action: When attached to a verb, ter- often indicates the action happened unintentionally or spontaneously. E.g. tersalah (to make a mistake inadvertently), terjatuh (accidentally fell), tertidur (fall asleep unintentionally).
2.	Superlative (most …): When attached to adjectives, ter- forms the superlative degree. E.g. terbesar (biggest), tercantik (prettiest)anyflip.com. Primary students learn this usage to say “the most/ -est”. Usually taught with examples like paling vs ter-: paling tinggi and tertinggi both mean “tallest”. Malay forbids combining paling and ter- (so not terpaling). A common mistake to watch: writing teramat or ter… sekali repetitively. But typically, ter- usage for superlative is straightforward: just prefix it.
3.	Ability or potential: In some words, ter- can mean “can be easily X” or a certain state. E.g. terbuka (opened, or can be opened), terlihat (visible), terdengar (audible). This overlaps with passive meaning sometimes.
4.	In idioms or fixed phrases: ter can form words like terus (straight/continue, not clearly from rus), tertawa (to laugh, from tawa). These just need memorization.
Teaching ter-:
o	For accidents: show a picture or act out an “oops!” moment. Tumpah (spill) vs tertumpah (spilled inadvertently). Saya menumpahkan air (I spilled water, maybe implying accidentally but grammatically active) vs Air tertumpah (the water got spilled). Show difference: one focuses on the doer, one on the incident.
o	For superlatives: maybe a chart of tallest, fastest, etc in class (this can be fun, measure heights and say Ali yang tertinggi in class).
o	Remind that ter- in front of an adjective means “most”, but ter- in front of a verb often implies no intent. Secondary students often get questions on whether to use ter- or di- in a sentence (like is it accidental or deliberate passive).
•	Circumfix ke-…-an – This affix pair turns words into nouns indicating a state, quality, or abstract concept. For example, baik (good) → kebaikan (goodness, a virtue), benar (true) → kebenaran (truth), sakit (sick/pain) → kesakitan (pain, a state of hurt), tinggi (high) → ketinggian (height). It can also nominalize verbs: datang (come) → kedatangan (arrival), lupa (forget) → kelupaan (an instance of forgetting, rarely used), or kehadiran (presence, from hadir). Additionally, ke-…-an forms collective nouns or “-ness” and sometimes unintentional passive (though the latter is advanced: e.g. terluka vs kelukaan, etc.). Primary kids might encounter words like kebenaran or kesihatan (health, from sihat = healthy). Teaching tip: Tell them ke-…-an wraps around an adjective to make a noun, like adding “-ness” or “-ity” in English (lembut – soft, kelembutan – softness; unit – unique, keunikan – uniqueness). They don’t need to produce them early, but recognizing them helps reading comprehension.
•	Circumfix peN-…-an – This pair forms abstract nouns too, often meaning the act, process, or result of the base verb: e.g. pendidikan (education, from didik – educate)prpm.dbp.gov.my, pendengaran (hearing, sense of hearing, from dengar), penglihatan (sight, vision, from lihat), pembangunan (development, from bangun – to build or rise). Many abstract concepts in Malay (especially official terms) are peN-…-an words. They often correspond to English nouns ending in -tion or -ment (development, agreement, etc.). For teaching: Once students know peN- for people/tools and -an for result, you can say combining them often yields the name of the activity or field. For instance, pem+baca+an = pembacaan (the act of reading or a reading). Per+iksa (examine) → pemeriksaan (examination, the process of inspecting). It might be heavy for primary, but by upper primary or secondary, they start using these in essays. A good scaffold is to list a verb, its peN- agent noun, and its peN-…-an noun: e.g. ajar – pengajar (person) – pengajaran (teaching, as a concept or lesson taught).
•	Other prefixes from borrowings: Malay has prefixes like juru- (from Sanskrit, indicating skilled person: jurulatih – coach, juruterbang – pilot), maha- (great/ultra: maha penting – very important, mahasiswa – university student (great learn-person)), eka- (one), anti-, pro-, etc., as listed in advanced sources. For younger learners, these are not priority except maybe anti- (anti), auta- (auto), since these are international. If they appear in reading, just explain meaning.
•	Infixes (sisipan): Malay has a handful of infixes like -el-, -er-, -em-, -in- embedded in some older words. For example telunjuk (index finger, with -el- infix in tunjuk), gerigi (serrated, from gigi teeth with -er-), gemuruh (thunderous, from guruh thunder with -em-). There are maybe 4 common infixes and they don’t form new words in modern use – they exist in certain fixed words. Students usually learn them just for trivia or specific vocab. You can mention: “Malay sometimes inserts bits inside a word, but there’s no method to create new ones – just learn the examples.” If someone asks, “What’s sisipan -in-?” you can give sambung (connect) → sinambung (continuous, archaic) as an example, but again, extremely rare to need at school level. Possibly skip unless covering all affix types.
Teaching advanced affixes:
•	Focus on recognition: Many of these affixes (ke-…-an, peN-…-an, etc.) are easier to recognize and understand in context than to use actively for a learner. So practice breaking down complex words: pertanggungjawaban looks scary, but if you spot per-…-an it’s a noun, root tanggungjawab (responsibility) so it means "accountability". Train students to identify root + affixes to guess meaning.
•	Use charts and tables: Secondary textbooks often have charts of affixes and examples. Creating a reference table (maybe one column for each category: noun affixes, verb affixes, adj affixes) can help organize thoughts. For example:
Affix	Type	Example	Meaning
meN-	verb (active)	memasak (from masak)	to cook anyflip.com

di-	verb (passive)	dimasak	is cooked/by…
beR-	verb (intransitive)	berjalan (from jalan)	to walk anyflip.com

peN-	noun (actor/tool)	penulis (from tulis)	writer 
peN-…-an	noun (action/abstract)	penulisan (from tulis)	writing (the act/art)
ke-…-an	noun (state)	kebenaran (from benar)	truth 
-kan	verb (transitive causative)	menampalkan (from tampal = stick)	to stick something (on)
-i	verb (transitive locative)	menampali (not common; menampal is used)	(conceptually, to stick onto [target])
•	This is just a conceptual table; actual teaching might break it into smaller parts.
•	Error correction practice: For older students, provide sentences with affix errors (very common in exam prep). E.g. Dia telah terbunuh ular itu dengan kayu. (Wrong: he didn’t accidentally kill the snake, he did it on purpose, so should be Dia telah membunuh ular itu…). Or Masalah itu dirungkai oleh mereka. (Should be dirungkaikan or better dirungkai depending on context? Actually rungkai seldom used in passive, maybe diselesaikan). Such exercises hone their understanding of function.
Conclusion: Mastering Malay imbuhan is like having the keys to unlock meaning and form sentences correctly. We started with core affixes (meN-, beR-, peN-, -kan, -i) critical for primary learners to express basic ideas and gradually introduced the full range they'll see by secondary level. By using clear patterns, plenty of examples, and engaging practice (mnemonics like “Sony Pam Tin Kosong” for meN-, analogies for -kan vs -i, and so on), learners can build a strong foundation. The knowledge base formed here supports a self-directed learning journey: students can refer back to the rules, test themselves by generating sentences, and even predict if something “sounds right” in Malay. With continuous feedback and correction of misconceptions, they will gain confidence in using imbuhan – eventually using affixes to generate new words, understand nuanced meanings, and form grammatically solid sentences in Malay. Selamat belajar!
